My own local docker service, patched on the basis of different
warehouses, just to suit my personal needs.

## License

This project is inspired by and builds upon the work of several other open
source projects. We acknowledge their contributions and encourage users to
explore and support those projects as well.

Their different projects use different protocols, and they should be
supported.However, different license may also conflict with each other,
so the most relaxed [MIT](./LICENSE) is adopted.
